•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Following guidelines for best practices is a good place to start in ensuring that code is functional and secure. There are well documented approaches to developing software that one could do to best prepare their work. Throughout the project that we were working on, a careful attention to detail was placed on the testing phase of development. This went a long way in ensuring that our code works as intended, which is important when a simple oversight could prove devastating to a public application.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting the needs of the user revolved around laying them out in addressable milestones. It is important not only to break a project down into smaller steppingstones, but to have a complete understanding of the work that is being asked of us. While working on this project I simply wrote out all the specific requirements and tested them as they were implemented. 

•	How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software as a marathon. It is easy to fall into a productivity trap where you want to get as much work done as quickly as possible. I find this often to be counterproductive however, and have fallen back on a slower more methodical approach where the quality of the code far outweighs the quantity of it.
